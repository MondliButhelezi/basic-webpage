        <p>
          I want to go to Kyoto because I want to see their pristine natural
          scenery which includes Mt. Fuji, see some of the world’s most
          beautiful waterfalls and view the blooming of the pink cherry blossoms
          that bloom during winter. I also want to experience the Japanese
          cuisine like kaiseki, the sushi conveyor belt and sake bars.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also want to see the beautiful temples and zen gardens like the
          Inari Shrine is Fushimi Inari, which is dedicated to Inari, the Shinto
          god of rice. Lastly its because of people, society and culture Japan
          has. I want to go there to experience the anime side of the place
          because it is the birth place of worldwide famous anime titles like
          Dragonball Z, One Piece and Naruto to name a few

          understand the natives of Japan when they would be talking which
          ofcourse will make my immersion there more exciting!!

        <p>
          In 1994, the District Six Museum came into being. The museum came into
          being as a vehicle for advocating social justice, as a space for
          reflection and contemplation, and as an institution for challenging
          the distortions and half-truths which propped up the history of Cape
          Town and South Africa.

          On Cape Town's Grand Parade stands an imposing Italian
          Renaissance-style Edwardian building constructed from honey limestone.
          Cape Town's City Hall took five years to complete, after the laying of
          its cornerstone in 1900. It is famous because Nelson Mandela gave a
          speech from the balcony of City Hall immediately upon his release from
          prison. This was his first public address in 27 years, during which he
          spoke about his commitment to democracy, peace and reconciliation.
