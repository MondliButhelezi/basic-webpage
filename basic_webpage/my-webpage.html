            <p>
              I want to go to Kyoto because I want to see their pristine natural
              scenery which includes Mt. Fuji, see some of the world’s most
              beautiful waterfalls and view the blooming of the pink cherry blossoms
              that bloom during winter. I want to go there to experience the anime side of the place
              because it is the birth place of worldwide famous anime titles like
              Dragonball Z, One Piece and Naruto to name a few.

          learn it so that when one day I get to travel there, I will able to
          understand the natives of Japan when they would be talking which
          ofcourse will make my immersion there more exciting!!
